# didactic-carnival
A carnival that like Gradio and FastAPI

This is a toy repository that plays with concepts in API development. Additionally, it experiments with `Gradio` as an alternative to `Streamlit`. The project involves creating a mock chatbot that uses `MongoDB` to persist conversations. Just run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
